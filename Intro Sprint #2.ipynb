    "\n",
    "# Web Scraping with Twitter and Reddit\n",
    "\n",
    "Modified from the Fall 2020 workshop by [Melanie Walsh](https://melaniewalsh.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Collect Social Media Data?\n",
    "* Maybe you're interested in internet language trends, like this [Pudding article about the rise of \"lol\" on Reddit](https://pudding.cool/2019/10/laugh/#lol).\n",
    "* Maybe you're interested in Twitter bots, trolls, or online protest movements, like this [NYT article about Twitter bots and Hong Kong protestors or this 538 article about Russian trolls](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/18/world/asia/hk-twitter.html).\n",
    "* Maybe you're interested in how online communities develop and relate to each other, like this [mapping of subreddits](https://lmcinnes.github.io/subreddit_mapping/subreddit_map.html) or this [538 piece about how people respond to politicians on Twitter](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-worst-tweeter-in-politics-isnt-trump/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Can We Collect Social Media Data Using Computational Tools?\n",
    "\n",
    "### APIs vs Web Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "An **Application Programming Interface** (API) allows you to programmatically extract and interact with data under the hood of websites, social networks, and other projects that make their data publicly available. Twitter and Reddit both offer APIs that allow users to access their data. However, because these APIs are controlled by the companies themselves, they also come with limitations. For example, Twitter does not allow users to collect tweets more than one week in the past without a paid subscription.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way that you might collect data from the internet or social media is via web scraping. When you get data from an API, you're getting data from an internal source (from \"inside\" Twitter). When you \"scrape\" the surface of a web page, you're getting data from the user-facing surface of a web page, just like the web page you would pull up if you opened Chrome and typed \"twitter.com\". This makes web scraping sometimes clunky and unreliable when compared to an API, although it's often the only option if there's not an available API or the API does not offer what you're looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reddit\n",
    "\n",
    "Though Reddit has its own API, there is a more popular API for working with Reddit called **Pushshift**. You can read more about Pushshift in this arXiv article: https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08435 (PDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Why do people use Pushshift’s API instead of the official Reddit API?\n",
    ">\n",
    ">In short, Pushshift makes it much easier for researchers to query and retrieve historical Reddit data, provides extended functionality by providing fulltext search against comments and submissions, and has larger single query limits.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Jason Baumgartner, et al., \"The Pushshift Reddit Dataset\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install PSAW\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with the Pushshift API, we're going to install and use a Python wrapper called [PSAW](https://github.com/dmarx/psaw)."
